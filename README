implementation of the global history reconstruction algorithm from https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~tullsen/halfandhalf.pdf

Generate assembly by running python script (will generate header.h and functions.s)

Make to build binary

Run with sudo (for access to performance counters)

Will spit out history length and mispredict rate in the style of figure 2a of the half&half paper
